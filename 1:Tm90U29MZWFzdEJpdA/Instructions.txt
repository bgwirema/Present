Happy Birthday!

Welcome to the challenge!
It consists of a series of file bins.
Each one has a picture of Pi with a hidden flag that will take you to the next file bin.

The final file bin has a present in it :)


General tips:
The length of the flags may vary by a few characters.
There should be something obvious when you find the flag.
There's normally not a way to ctr-f the flag.
Some of the methods are my own concoction, python coding is helpful.
Some of the methods build off previous puzzles.
If you get stuck the URLs are hints / names for the puzzles :)
